# Fun Pop Quiz

I want to build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

```
AS A quiz player
I WANT to take a timed quiz that stores high scores and initials
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a pop quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a 60 seconds timer starts and I am presented with the first shuffled question
WHEN I answer a question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN 10 seconds is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
